# BLOOMS MVP - *The Charitable Way*

This project contains a `.ipynb` file with the code for the Minimal Viable Product of BLOOMS, which is a non-profit service for donors to track the impact they make with their donations to charitable institutions. BLOOMS makes use of smart contracts, APIs and web scraping technology that allows for tokenisation of digital, monetary transactions along with collecting additional information such as charity ratings and news to assess the impact of individual donations. This project contains the code for extracting information from an API and a web scrapter to illustrate the features of the MVP. 

## Installation

To run the current code, the latest version of `Python` is required. Packages will be defined in the project. A separate file has been included to request data from the API in a `.http` file. For this, a `REST` installation is required. 

## Usage

The current status of the project only allows to showcase the potential of the project. It is not yet in the operable stage.
